Developed the project using ReactJS using TypeScript as the main language, developed commons, components, implemented Redux, and integrated the API.\n * Continuously worked closely with designers and business analysts to make changes and tweaks to the UX/UI design, completing the project 2 months ahead of schedule. Proactively coordinated cross-departmental collaboration to unify UX/UI changes, resulting in early delivery and 15% project cost savings. Additionally, optimized API calls using React Query, reducing data latency by 30%.\n *  ***Technologies: ReactJS, React hook form, React query, TypeScript, Redux, REST API, JWT, Axios, TailwindCSS, Icomoon.***",
